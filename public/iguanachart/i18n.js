Long time ago, it was observed that prices move in trends and history trends to repeat itself. In other words, chart analysis uses chart patterns to predict future price movements.","5945":"Consider one of the most popular attributes of chart analysis: a price level which is known as resistance. The resistance on charts tends to act as a barrier from preventing the price of a security from moving upward. That\u2019s why resistance levels are also regarded as a ceiling.","5946":"Such price behavior can result from various factors. For example, a large group of stockholders wants to sell big number of their shares only when\u00a0prices\u00a0reach a\u00a0certain level.","5947":"In the chart below, notice how the price bounced off support four times in a row.

It\u2019s just impossible. Technical analysis is one of the tools to measure the likelihood ratio of a price direction.","14592":"The key difference between technical and fundamental analysis is that the first one doesn\u2019t explore the cause of price movement. But it may suggest what a stock will do in the future, so a trader can behave accordingly.","14594":"There are three basic types of charts.","14595":"Line Chart","14596":"A line chart is created by connecting a series of past prices for a period of time together with a line.","14597":"The main disadvantage of a line chart is that you can\u2019t see intra-day price movements.","14600":"A bar chart is comprised of a series of vertical lines, each of which indicates the intra-day changes of a price.","14633":"Chinese lanterns","14601":"For instance, if a price is rising during a day, its bar is green. And if a price is falling, its bar is red.","14602":"Vertical bar lines show intra-day price fluctuation. D is a day minimum, and C is a day maximum.","14603":"Horizontal bar lines indicate the price at the beginning of a trading session (A) and at the end of the session (B).","14604":"Bars have their time-frames. For example, 5 minute bar illustrates the summary of stock activity for  5 minutes: the price of the first and the last trades, as well as the highest and the lowest price for this period.","14607":"Just like a bar chart, every element of Japanese candlestick chart shows 4 values of a stock price, but the element itself looks different.","14608":"Colors of candles indicate whether prices rise or fall. Usually, green color illustrates the price rising and red one is for the falling price.","14609":"Japanese candlestick is one of the most popular charting techniques to analyze the market. In contrast to the elements of a bar chart, a candle has its body which helps traders\u00a0to gauge the surrounding of a stock and, probably, make better predictions.","14611":"How to predict price movements with trend lines and price levels","14612":"Trends - the general direction of security prices \u2013 can head up or down, and vary in length from weeks to years.","14613":"What drives trends? There are different triggers: economic cycles, political factors, etc. For instance, one of the main reasons why oil prices have been falling is that oil production has increased every year since 2008, but the world oil consumption has been brought down.","14614":"As previously mentioned, the cause of price movement isn't so valuable for technical analysis, because it's explored as soon as a trend begins. More important is to catch the moment when a trend starts.","14615":"In January, 2015 you bought Apple shares for $5000.

The main idea is that you can just copy someone's orders if you have no time to develop your own strategy. Copied traders use their money, therefore they\u2019re really interested to get profit.","14784":"There are two sides in replication process: masters \u2013 people whose orders are copied, and subscribers \u2013 people who copy masters' orders.","14785":"Before a master\u2019s order gets to an exchange, his broker checks whether the master has sufficient funds in his account to execute the order. If it is so, the order is sent to an exchange.","14786":"So, the master placed his order. Then, right after the broker confirmed that the amount of funds was sufficient and sent the order to the exchange, a relevant replicator has received a notification. Normally, there are several hundred milliseconds between the moment when an order is received by a broker and sent to an exchange.","14787":"As soon as the new order notification has been received, the replicator looks for the subscribers to the master\u2019s order and checks subscribers\u2019 parameters in its database.","14788":"If the replicator found a proper subscriber to the master\u2019s order, it tries to send exactly the same (or modified in accordance with subscriber\u2019s parameters) order to the exchange.","12847":"TXT order","14791":"When creating a new replicator, you get to its settings. Adjust them to control their behavior.","14792":"Strict or non-strict copying","14794":"When copying non-strict, a replicator doesn\u2019t check the current number of securities in a subscriber\u2019s portfolio. Therefore, this mode is faster. That\u2019s why it might be useful when copying several masters. ","14798":"Reverse copying lets you follow master's actions in a reverse mode \u2013 when he buys, you sell and vice versa.","14801":"Reverse copying may be useful if a master is you. Thus you can find the weaknesses of your strategy.","14803":"There are some options to avoid additional risks.","14845":"Spread, %","14804":"First of all, you can limit the total amount of your loss arising from your masters\u2019 actions. In this mode, when the current copied order has been executed, a replicator compares the total amount of accumulated losses and a limit predefined by you. If the amount is over the limit, it\u2019ll switch off. Please note that the system cannot limit your losses, it just switches off when the losses reach the predefined amount.","14807":"How to choose a master and start copying","14808":"It can be pretty compelling to search the master whose trades you want to copy. Let\u2019s give a peace of advice on this account.","14809":"Under the left tab, there is search where you can specify your criteria and select a trader you want to copy.","14810":"When selecting a trader to copy, we recommend you to pay your attention not only to general profit and returns levels, but to the consistency of this trader's results.","14813":"Things replicators can and cannot do","14814":"A replicator cannot ensure exactly the same buying or selling stock price as master\u2019s one. All the orders are sent to exchanges sequentially. So, even if delays are minimal, the market situation may change significantly by the time your order is received.","14815":"A replicator cannot guarantee that you buy or sell securities at exactly the same moment as a master does, because an exchange may close or your order may be rejected.","15926":"Please enter the code you have received via SMS.","14816":"When a replicator fails to execute an order, it forgets about that order and tries to copy the next one.","14879":"Bank response timeout","15506":"Sent","14817":"Replicators send you sms or email notifications. We exhort you to read them and pay your careful attention to activity in your account.","14818":"Also it's better to select a master who has equal portfolio volume.

It\u2019s a flat or sideways trend, the main specific of which is that there is nor serial rising of maximums, nor serial falling of minimums.","14903":"To indicate a trend on a price chart we draw two sloping lines framing it.","14904":"Rising trend:","14754":"Card:","14905":"a line connects points of local minimums (line AB).","14906":"Falling trend:","14907":"a line connects points of local maximums (line BC).","14908":"A trend is over when a price chart becomes flat (point B).","14909":"What are support and resistance levels?","14910":"Support and resistance levels are the lines connecting points of minimums and maximums in flat areas.","14912":"holding a line of a price chart from getting lower.","14913":"Resistance line:","14914":"holding a line of a price chart from getting higher.","4101":"Order information","14915":"Usually, there are lots of trades on those levels, so the trading volume is high.","14916":"When a price breaks out a resistance level (point A), the level turns into a support one.

Such situations occur when a price is reaching the level which has not been broken out before. Traders understand that it\u2019s possible the price won\u2019t breakout the level at this time and act accordingly.","14922":"Those principals underlie strategies when trading with price channels. The channel is the space between support and resistance levels. The price stays within the channel, and traders buy a security when its price is near the bottom of the trading channel or sell it when the price gets close to the top of the trading channel.","16300":"To place an order, get and register a digital signature.

When copying strict, a replicator copies only those master\u2019s orders which create exactly the same positions in a subscriber\u2019s portfolio. Roughly speaking, if the strict mode is off, and a master has closed the position which isn\u2019t in the subscriber\u2019s portfolio at the moment, the subscriber sells short. ","15751":"Imagine, that you have copied the orders of three masters trading the same security. If the strict mode is on, one of the masters may block the actions of the others. As a result you may have this one master\u2019s corrupted position instead of getting average profit. ","15752":"Please note that the reverse mode has some limitations. For instance, a master has placed a buy order, but you cannot sell the security if it isn\u2019t shortable. So, the reverse copying is useless when trading low liquid stocks.","15753":"Besides, a reverse order is placed when the master\u2019s order has been executed. Therefore, there is longer than direct mode delay between the moment a replicator receives a notification and the moment it creates a relevant position in your portfolio.","15754":"In addition to the limitation of the total loss in your account, you can specify Auto Stop levels designed to limit the amount of loss on a position by closing an open position when it reaches a pre-specified price, even if a master don\u2019t use this condition. You may close positions earlier than a master does, but you can control the amount of loss on each position.
